@package CompoundPye.src.Sensors.filter_funcs
Contains filter functions, creating input filters that will be multiplied with 
an array of input intensities that a sensor 'observes'.

Currently contains only one- and two-dimensional gaussian filter.

    Creates a two-dimensional gaussian filter-array.
    
    The size of the array is intrinsically defined by the parameter cut_off. cut_off is the lowest 
    relative value that is still to be included in the filter-array, looking 
    at each direction individually. 
    For example, if cut_off is 0.1, the filter-array stretches in x-direction up to a 
    value x_i, for which exp(-x_i^2 / 2 / sigma_x^2) > 0.1, 
    while exp(-x_(i + 1)^2 / 2 / sigma_x ^ 2) <= 0.1.  
    @param cut_off Sets the relative value that is still to be included in the array; 
    defines filter-array size intrinsically.
    @param sigma List or array of two sigma values, one for each input dimension.
    @param amplitude Amplitude of the gaussian function at (x,y)=(0,0).
    @param search_step One can increase or decrease computational efficiency by changing 
    the search_step; never tested how well this works, though.
