"""
@package CompoundPye.src.Sensors
Provides Sensor classes. 

Sensors contain information about 'what they see' in the System's Surroundings. They have connections to Components to pass their sensory information to a network of Components.
Usually you should provide the Sensor's output to an input filter, which has the job to somehow normalize the Sensor's output. A tool for normalization is not provided in the Sensor unit itself yet.
